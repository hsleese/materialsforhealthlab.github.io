		C3Bio PhD Researcher (Oct 2020-) <br>
		<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Meltem obtained her BSc and MSc degrees in Physics from Marmara University and Yildiz Technical University in 2012 and 2015, respectively. Her MSc project focused on developing biosensors for detection of heavy metal ions and bacteria in liquids. She is a current PhD student in the Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department working on the ‘’Development of Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Based Sensor Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic Bacteria’’ supervised by Dr Pedro Estrela and co-supervised by Dr Hannah Leese and Dr Maisem Laabei. With this study, it is aimed to detect bacteria harmful to human health such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae in water using molecularly imprinted polymer based sensors. </p>

		<p> Sadeka Nujhat <br>
		PhD Researcher (Jan 2022-)<br>
		<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Sadeka is currently a PhD researcher working on developing a microfluidic device for the early ovarian cancer detection, supervised by Dr Sandhya Moise and Dr Hannah Leese. This project focuses on the analysis of exosomes as biomarkers for cancer detection. Sadeka graduated in Biomedical Science (BSc) and Genomic Medicine (MSc) from Queen Mary University of London. For her MSc thesis, Sadeka analysed genomic data to establish potential genetic mutations that contribute to the development of familial acute myeloid leukaemia in the Barts Cancer Institute (BCI). She later joined BCI as a lab technician handling cancer clinical trial samples. </p>
